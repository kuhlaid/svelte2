This is a Svelte app. It is also a progressive web app. The goal of this app is to demonstrate how to build as Svelte 
front-end UI that pulls data from a server API. This app is only a week into development so there are no OHHH and AHHH
monments just yet. If you want to play along with this code then you will also want to have a server side app like https://github.com/kuhlaid/laravel2020.03.31
to test server API calls.
