- I started building this Svelte app using the starter Svelte template at https://github.com/sveltejs some of the following comands to copy a basic Svelte template and the modules I would use to develop the app:
```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte2
cd svelte2
npm install
npm install bootstrap
npm install rollup-plugin-copy
npm install workbox-sw
npm install rollup-plugin-workbox
npm install gulp
npm install workbox-build
```
